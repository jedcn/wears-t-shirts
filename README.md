# wears-t-shirts

## What even is this?

I wear one of these t-shirts each working day. I think of them as similar to
stickers on a laptop.

They are commonly under a collared shirt or a sweater, but I will make sure the
one I am wearing is visible if I am speaking publicly or interviewing someone.
