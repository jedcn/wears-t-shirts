Project Include

## Author's Description

Change is hard, especially around a multidimensional issue like diversity. It is easy for all of us to become defensive and emotional, to shift the blame to others, and to feel fundamentally unheard or misunderstood. We have a hard-to-change diversity problem in tech in the United States.

Project Includeâ€™s mission is to give everyone a fair chance to succeed in tech.

We are a non-profit that uses data and advocacy to accelerate diversity and inclusion solutions in the tech industry. We are building a community to share recommendations and solutions for startup CEOs and employees.
