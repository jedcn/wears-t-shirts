## Author's Description

If I met a genie tomorrow, I'd wish these three things for our world:

* Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
* Kindness: the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.
* Respect: a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements.

This sentiment was written and letterpress printed as a sign I carried in the Seattle Women's March, but it's a message that needs to be spread as far and wide as possible.

All proceeds above cost will be donated to the International Rescue Committee and Refugee Women's Alliance, refugee aid organizations.
