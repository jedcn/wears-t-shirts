# wears-t-shirts

## What even is this?

I wear one of these t-shirts each working day. I think of them as similar to
stickers on a laptop.

They are commonly under a collared shirt or a sweater, but I will make sure the
one I am wearing is visible if I am speaking publicly or interviewing someone.

## Which t-shirts?

<% tshirts.each do |tshirt| -%>
* <a href="<%= tshirt['readme_href'] %>" alt="More about <%= tshirt['name'] %>"><%= tshirt['name'] %></a> by <%= tshirt['creator'] %>
<% end -%>

## Want to catch up?

If you like a t-shirt, want to talk about a t-shirt, or have a suggestion for a
new t-shirt-- you can reach me at hi@jedcn.com.

Be well. Help others be well.
